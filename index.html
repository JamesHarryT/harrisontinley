        <h2>üëΩ About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a senior in high school with a passion for creating and building things-especially games. During my junior year, I taught myself game development using 
          the Godot Engine, and I've been hooked ever since. After graduating, I plan to attend a junior college in California, where I'll be pursuing two Associate‚Äôs degrees: one in Computer Science and another in Engineering.
        </p>

        <p>
          I‚Äôm extremely dedicated to what I do, once I start a project, I feel compelled to finish it no matter what. When building this website, I stayed up nearly all night fixing bugs and learning as I went. I had no prior web development experience, so putting this together in just a few days was a real challenge. But I genuinely love learning new things, and I strongly believe that with enough time and effort, anything is possible.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the future, I hope to work on projects that challenge me both creatively and technically, whether it's a world-changing application or a fun, niche game. My dream is to create something that leaves a lasting impact, something people will remember me for.

        <h2>üéÆ Game Projects</h2>
        <h3>üëª Luck's Labyrinth</h3>
        <p>
          After creating several smaller projects in Godot, I challenged myself to build a complete game from start to finish. That challenge became 
          <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2919770/Lucks_Labyrinth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luck's Labyrinth</a>, 
          a game I developed over eight months of daily work.
        </p>

        <p>
          This project pushed me harder than anything before. It wasn‚Äôt just about making a game. It was about learning everything that goes into one. Along the way, I:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Integrated the <strong>Steamworks SDK</strong> and successfully launched the game on <strong>Steam</strong></li>
          <li>Programmed <strong>enemy and boss AI</strong> systems from scratch</li>
          <li>Taught myself <strong>music composition</strong> and <strong>pixel art</strong> to meet the creative demands of the project</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          While it‚Äôs not perfect, it represents a huge leap in my skills and confidence. I'm proud of what I built. More than anything, it showed me that the big ideas in my head are actually possible to create.
        </p>

        <h2>üöß In progress</h2>
        <p>
          I'm currently developing a 3D game in Godot that combines 2D elements with tower defense and roguelike mechanics. It's a personal challenge that's pushing me to learn a lot, especially when it comes to using Godot Resources to efficiently generate enemies, items, and more. There's still a long way to go, but I'm excited about the progress and can‚Äôt wait to share the finished game!

        <h3>üéûÔ∏è Blender</h3>
        <p>
          Like most 3d artists my journey started with the youtube donut course. But, also here are a few animations I made. Since most of my focus is on Godot, these were more like side projects.<br>

        <h3>üéµ FL Studio</h3>
        <p>
          During development, I started experimenting with FL Studio to create music for my game. It was a fun and unexpected part of the process that opened up a whole new creative outlet. Most of the songs were made quickly, but learning the software was genuinely enjoyable. I still use it now just to make tracks for fun.
